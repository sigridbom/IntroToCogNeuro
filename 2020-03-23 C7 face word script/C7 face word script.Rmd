```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, pastecs)
```


```{r cars}
df <- read.delim("wordlist.txt", header = T)

plot(df$score_pc, df$score_warriner)

cor.test(df$score_pc, df$score_warriner)

```

Negatively correlated. As the score_pc increase the score_warriner decrease.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
