plot(df$score_pc, df$score_warriner)

cor.test(df$score_pc, df$score_warriner)

```

Negatively correlated. As the score_pc increase the score_warriner decrease.
Pearson's cor = -0.94 (very highly correlated, almost perfect correlation). 
Pearson's correlation test was found to be significant, t(358) = -50.186, p<.01
